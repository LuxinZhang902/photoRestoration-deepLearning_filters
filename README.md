# Introduction

This repo includes our self-implemented algorithm (cv_alg) and the scoring algorithm for the project in ECE588 in Fall 2023.

# Running the Code

```python
python3 main.py
```

By running the code in the main, we can get the Excel output and the compare images in the directory of result_out

# Directories

## ./algorithm

This is the directory that we store all the algorithms that are used for the scoring algrithm.

## ./DLPic

This is the directory that we store all the output of restoration using the deep learning algorithm

## ./OldPic

This is the directory that we store all the old pictures

## ./SelfPic

This is the directory that we store all the output of our self-implemented algorithm
